AI-Powered Sports Talent Ecosystem

## 2. Problem Statement Description

Most athletes in India, especially from underserved regions, face barriers like lack of access to professional training, gender inequality, financial instability, and biased opportunities. Female athletes remain underrepresented, and many struggle with unreliable funding or resources. These challenges prevent fair talent discovery and growth.

Our solution is an AI-powered sports platform that democratizes access to training, tracks performance scientifically, manages finances securely, and connects athletes with coaches, institutions, and sponsors. By bridging gaps with technology, we aim to build an inclusive, data-driven ecosystem that helps athletes reach their full potential.
