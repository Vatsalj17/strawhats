AI Exercise Coach â€” Single-file React component (App.jsx)

Dependencies (install in your client project):
  npm install @tensorflow/tfjs @tensorflow-models/pose-detection @mediapipe/pose lucide-react

If you use Vite React template, create project first:
  npm create vite@latest client -- --template react
  cd client
  npm install
  npm install @tensorflow/tfjs @tensorflow-models/pose-detection @mediapipe/pose lucide-react
  npm run dev

This single file contains:
 - camera + model initialization (MoveNet SINGLEPOSE_THUNDER for higher accuracy)
 - real-time detection loop (requestAnimationFrame)
 - visual overlay (joints, skeleton, confidence)
 - exercise checks (squat, bicep curls) with rep counters and form scores
 - UI: start/pause, exercise selector, stats, chat feedback

Note: This is a self-contained example for quick testing. For production split into modules.
